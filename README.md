# Python-Basic-TicTacToe
Hello, Thank you for using my very basic TicTacToe game :)
I am a student learning Python, and I accomplished something big for myself(Creating this game) so I wanted to share with you guys my work for anyone who ever needs it

currently the features of the game are :
* Basic TicTacToe board, and X(turtle)/O characters
* basic Win checker, in my opinion I would be able to remake the game in the future in a way that it will be more efficient 

There are some things I would like to add in the future to the game, and they are :
* Main Menu(currently unlikely)
* Replay button for ease of use
I might add them later when I get the required motivation, and if I do enjoy the extra features : )

Python version - 3.8.1

used library Turtle for the visual interface

Notes - X is a turtle and O...is an O , I used the available Turtle library default sprites
