# Python-Basic-TicTacToe
Hello, Thank you for using my very basic TicTacToe game :)
I am a student learning Python, and I accomplished something big for myself(Creating this game) so I wanted to share with you guys my work for anyone who ever needs it

currently the features of the game are :
* Basic TicTacToe board, and X/O characters
* basic Win checker, in my opinion I would be able to remake the game in the future in a way that it will be more efficient 
* Replay button
* Clicking sounds
* Basic score system

W.I.P things I might add in the future :
* AI

Python version - 3.8.9

used Turtle library for the visual interface
